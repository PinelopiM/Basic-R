R Code for Statistical Analysis and Data Visualization
This repository contains R code used for statistical analysis and visualization of data obtained from metabolite quantification or gene expression analysis.

Overview
The provided R scripts cover a range of commonly used statistical analyses and visualization methods. These analyses include:

Descriptive statistics
Normality testing
Homogeneity of variance testing
Parametric and non-parametric statistical tests (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA, Wilcoxon test, Kruskal-Wallis test)
Post hoc pairwise comparisons (e.g., Tukey's HSD test, Dunn's test)
Data visualization using ggplot2 and pheatmap

Usage
The code is organized into sections based on the type of analysis performed. Each section contains commented R code along with explanatory notes to guide users through the analysis process.

Note on Data Availability
Unfortunately, the data used in these analyses cannot be provided, as they are unpublished.
